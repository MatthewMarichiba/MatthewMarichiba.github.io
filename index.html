                <li><b>California Community Colleges (CCC) NOVA web app, nova.ccco.edu</b> -
                    I helped build NOVA, a system for tracking project applications, funding, and expenditure reporting
                    across California's community college system. Team size ranged from just me, up to 15 people, with
                    me acting as technical team lead for most of my time on the team. I was heavily involved in feature
                    planning and implementation from the engineering side, both front and back end, with heavy emphasis
                    on data schema, creating reusable components and workflows, and browser testing. This project
                    involved multiple one-time data migrations with frequent schema changes, as the app overtook
                    multiple other systems and funding sources. The system is based on Angular and Node.js
                    Express. Product features are demonstrated in
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D75Vl3ce79w">this training video</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>School Information Center for Learning Management System (LMS)</b> -
                    I built custom plugins for New Tech Network's LMS, which provide deep-dive views into a school's
                    courses, students, and grades. This project was a solo effort. The system is based on AngularJS for
                    the front end, and a commercial LMS service as the backend. Product features are demonstrated in
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UFpu0NpE4">this training video</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>Student Report Cards for Learning Management System (LMS)</b> -
                    I built a custom report card generator for New Tech Network's LMS with one other team member.
                    This project required extensive integration with a commercial LMS API (Agilix Buzz) to gather data
                    and a custom PHP service to collate data and generate PDFs. Product features are demonstrated in
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq_TRClfKRM&t=64s">this video</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>Simple YouTube Shortcode</b> -
                    I released this WordPress.org plug-in that translates shortcode
                    strings into an embedded frame for YouTube player, because I needed it to develop a client's
                    YouTube-heavy website. This plugin is now defunct, but was popular in its day. The skeleton can be found
                    <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-youtube-shortcode/">here</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>jTab Guitar Tab Shortcode</b> -
                    I built this WordPress.org plug-in that integrates an open-source guitar notation library into a
                    WordPress blog, allowing users to easily notate guitar chords and tabs with shortcodes.
                    This plugin is now defunct, but its skeleton can be found
                    <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jtab-guitar-tab-shortcode/">here</a>.
